        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my family's favorite cookie recipe. 
            They are not too crunchy, not too chewy.
            They also have a great balance in flavor between the rather cakey cookie portion and the milk chocolate chips.
            My mother used to bake them occasionally when I was a child.
            I learned to bake as a teen, and baked them quite frequently.
            I look forward to helping my own children bake them someday.
