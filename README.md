# Odin-Recipes
This project is focused on learning to build a website using HTML.
The example subject is recipes.

This project provided me with a real-life applicable use for HTML, building a simple recipe site. The project allowed me to practice all I have been learning about making a HTML boilerplate or essentially a basic page template. It also enabled me to get more practice in linking pages together, adding images, and other basic formatting tools in HTML I have learned about thus far.
